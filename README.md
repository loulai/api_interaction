Github Profiles
===
experimenting with APIs
---

I pair programmed with [Emma Williams], a fellow aspiring developer, to learn how to use APIs.

This is a simple project that allows a user to view and add different github profiles to a list. The list is hosted on a server and is styled.

Through this project, we're aiming to get a better grasp of the fundamentals of *JSON*, *jQuery* , *Mustache* , *Ajax* and *Javascript*.

Certain files have been edited and cloned from [this repository].

**Tech**
